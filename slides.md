### Architectural changes affect everyone...

Security

Compliance

"Operations"

Development

Infrastructure

"Platform"

Finance

---

### And the way they operate.

-------

| Architectural Change | Operational Change |
|:---|:---|
| Container architecture | Vulnerability Management |
| Microservices | Observability |
| GDPR | Data Inventory Reporting |
| Continuous Delivery | Change Advisory Boards? |

### Operability

> is the ability to keep a system in secure and reliable functioning condition

---

### A Fitness Function

> is a particular type of objective function that is used to
> summarize __how close__ a given design solution is to achieving the set aims.

### What did we like about it?

- KonMari method for former assumptions, tools, and telemetry
- Highlight gaps in process, tooling, and telemetry
- Relate technical decisioning to business value
- Organize stakeholder aims

---

### What would we improve?

- Try not to over-optimize
- Balance implemention with review from stakeholders

---

## What changed in our architecture that affects how effectively we operate?
