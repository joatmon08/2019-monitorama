# The Theories

---

### An Evolutionary Architecture

> supports __incremental, guided change__ as a first principle across multiple
> dimensions.

<small>"Building Evolutionary Architectures" by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, & Patrick Kua</small>

---

### A Fitness Function

> is a particular type of objective function that is used to
> summarize __how close__ a given design solution is to achieving the set aims.

---

### Shift-Left Testing

> integrates testing activities earlier in the engineering process (i.e.,
> Test-Driven Development).

<small>Concept originally from Larry Smith, 2001</small>

- __Premise:__ We should test how our technology architecture meets our goals at this
  point in time.
- __Premise:__ We should think about integrating testing activities earlier in our
  engineering process.
- __Conclusion:__ We should design fitness functions early in our engineering process.
