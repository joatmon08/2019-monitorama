# The Theories

---

### An Evolutionary Architecture

> supports __incremental, guided change__ as a first principle across multiple
> dimensions.

<small>"Building Evolutionary Architectures" by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, & Patrick Kua</small>

---

### A Fitness Function

> is a particular type of objective function that is used to
> summarize __how close__ a given design solution is to achieving the set aims.

<small>"Building Evolutionary Architectures" by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, & Patrick Kua</small>

---

### Shift-Left Testing

> integrates testing activities earlier in the engineering process (i.e.,
> Test-Driven Development).

<small>Concept originally from Larry Smith, 2001</small>

---

### Fitness Function-Driven Development

> introduces continuous feedback for architectural conformance and
> inform the development process as it happens, rather than after the fact.

<small>[Fitness Function-Driven Development](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/fitness-function-driven-development) by Rosemary Wang & Paula Paul</small>

---

### Operability

> is the ability to keep a system in secure and reliable functioning condition

---

### "Operability"-Driven Development

- Observability
- Security
- Compliance
- Resilience
- Performance

---

# In Practice

---

Could we express _fitness functions_ of
our operations architecture in code?

## Thank you!
