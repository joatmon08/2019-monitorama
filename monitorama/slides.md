### Operability

> is the ability to keep a system in secure and reliable functioning condition

---

### It's a quality to aim for across teams.

Security

Compliance

"Operations"

Development

Infrastructure

Platform

Finance

### Architecture changes often lead to operational changes.

Container architecture => vulnerability management

Microservices => observability

GDPR => data inventory reporting

Continuous Delivery => No more change advisory boards?

### A Fitness Function

> is a particular type of objective function that is used to
> summarize __how close__ a given design solution is to achieving the set aims.

### Let's try this.

Security ❤️

---

### What did we like about it?

- KonMari method for former assumptions, tools, and telemetry
- Highlight gaps in process, tooling, and telemetry
- Relate technical decisioning to business value
- Organize stakeholder aims

---

### What would we improve?

- Try not to over-optimize
- Balance implemention with review from stakeholders

---

## What changed in our architecture that affects how effectively we operate?

## Thank you!
